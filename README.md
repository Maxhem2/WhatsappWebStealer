Software for replacing the Whatsapp web qrcode with your Whatsapp Desktop's

Download all files of the repo and put them in a folder\
Install WhatsApp Beta from the Microsoft Store\
In whatshook.py input your servers credentials and create needed paths on your server\
In extension.js edit the link to match your server and WhatsHooks file path\
Install tampermonkey on the target browser, create a new userscript and copy-paste the content of extension.js, save\
Start whatshook.py on your machine, make sure to minimize the folder and ideally all other applications except WhatsApp Beta and (optionally) the python window

Sucess, if the browser with the extension installed now opens whatsapp web the qr code will be replaced with your WhatsApp Beta's

WhatsApp Beta must be visible at all times during the login process!
